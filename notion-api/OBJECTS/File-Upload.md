# File Upload

The File Upload object tracks the lifecycle of a file uploaded to Notion in the API.

> View [Working with files and media](doc:working-with-files-and-media) for a comprehensive, end-to-end guide to uploading and attaching files.

Once a file upload has a `status` of `"uploaded"`, pass its ID in a [file object](ref:file-object#files-uploaded-in-the-api-type-file_upload) with a `type` of `file_upload` to the API to attach it to blocks, pages, and databases in a Notion workspace.

## Object properties

The response of File Upload APIs like [Retrieve a file upload](ref:retrieve-a-file-upload) contains `FileUpload` objects with the following fields:

    "8-0": "`content_length`",
    "8-1": "Integer",
    "8-2": "Nullable. The total size of the file, in bytes. For pending `multi_part` uploads, this field is a running total based on the file segments uploaded so far and recalculated at the end during the [Complete a file upload](ref:complete-a-file-upload) step.",
    "9-0": "`upload_url`",
    "9-1": "String",
